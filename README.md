The task is to build a model that will determine the tone (neutral, positive, negative, Can’t tell) of the text. To do this, you will need to train the model on the training data. The resulting model will have to determine the class (neutral, positive, negative, Can’t tell) of test texts(test data that were not used to build the model) with maximum accuracy.Used 4 step process to clean the data like Remove stop words, lemmatization ,Punctuation, Tokenization. Used Logistic Rgression and SVC to find the accuracy .
